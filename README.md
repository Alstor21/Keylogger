# Keylogger_v0.1a

## FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY

In development and with missing features. This keylogger is made to target Windows 11/10 systems; use on Linux or Unix-based systems is not currently supported.

# Complete Features:
- key logging complete (to a txt file)

- Adding the script to the startup folder when clicked by the user to the startup folder in Windows 11 so it runs on user login.

- Hiding  the log file's location and obfuscating the contents in Base64 encoding.

- Separate Python file to unencode the Base64 output in the log file.

# Incomplete Features:

- Sending the log file to the attacker's server and delete the log file after sending every 30-60 minutes of uptime. **(In Progress)**

- Create copies of itself in multiple locations of the device (ensuring they are executed at startup as well).

- Compiling to an exe file and obfuscate the exe to evade anti-virus detection. **(Finale step of the project)**
